I created this counter which contain an HTML, a CSS file and also a JavaScript file. The operation is very simple, you have a number on the top, which at the very is 0 and below there'res 4 buttons: Reset value, +, - and the last is the Magic button. The top one is the 'Reset value' and it returs 0 whatever number you arrived a. The ones in the center are the + and - buttons, of course you can increase the number at the top with the + button or decrease with the - button. The last one is the 'Magic button', with which you can choose a positive or negative number to count from.
